Design a RESTful API for managing machines in the cloud
Note: There is no need for actual cloud integration

Context
There will be multiple clusters and each cluster will have zero or more machines. Each machine will have zero or more tags.

Also, each cluster will have a name and a cloud region, each machine will have a name, ip address, an instance-type.

The system should allow users to create clusters, create machines in a cluster, add tags to the machine when creating them, delete machines and clusters and perform operations like start, stop, reboot on a group of machines using tags.

Problem Statement
Your API should do everything required to manage the clusters and machines, except actually creating the machines in the cloud.

Deliverables:
Implementation of the API in Python using Flask or Go lang
Test cases
A README explaining the API instructions about how to run it locally
URL of the application deployed to Heroku/Digital Ocean/GCP/AWS
What are we looking for?
Problem solving approach
API design and it's completeness
